# JavaTheClient
A collection of libraries/modules that I have wrote for other projects that
can be used to interfere with the HTTP protocol directly or remotely

## Note
The libraries are separated into Java packages

# Current Packages/Libraries

## Base64Boy
This library is used to easily convert just about any digital document or file to a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
string which can be use to flexibly store and transport the converted file as a binary 

## HttpClientBoy
This library is used to easily interfere with HTTP protocols ( mainly GET and POST ). It is best used where a project written in Java
is needed to easily interfere with a RESTful API. The library can be modified to interfere with other types of HTTP requests.
